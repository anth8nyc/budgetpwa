# Budget Tracker READme


## Description

This application is designed to aid users in tracking expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. The application is a PWA and is therefore installable, and populates any offline inputted data when returning to an online status. This is meant to assist in the possibility of not having an internet connection during travel, to give users a fast and easy way to track their budget.
